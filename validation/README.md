Android validation terminal application for checking transportation access authorization and creating validation events. This application represents the entry point to controlled transportation networks where passengers present their cards for validation.

[⬅️ Back to Main Project](../README.md)

## Overview

This Android application simulates validation terminals found at transportation network entry points (metro gates, bus boarding, etc.). It validates contracts loaded by the [Reload Demo](../client/) and creates validation events that can be later verified by the [Control Demo](../control-app/).

**Role in Ecosystem**: Second step in the ticketing workflow - validates loaded contracts and grants/denies access to transportation networks.

**Validation Flow**: Season Pass → Multi-trip Ticket → Stored Value (in order of priority)

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- Android device with Android 7.0+ (API level 24+)
- NFC capability for contactless card reading
- **SAM (Security Access Module)** for Calypso card operations
- Compatible terminal hardware (see [tested terminals](#tested-terminals))

### Software Requirements
- Cards personalized using the [Reload Demo](../client/)
- Proper SAM configuration matching card security keys
- Network connectivity (optional, for centralized logging)

### Card Requirements
- Calypso cards with valid contracts loaded
- Storage cards with compatible contract structures
- Supported AIDs (see [Common Library](../common-lib/README.md#supported-card-applications))

- Access granted
- Remaining balance displayed

#### Failed Validations

**Insufficient Funds/Trips**:
- Multi-trip counter = 0
- Stored value < validation amount
- Access denied with balance information

**Expired Contracts**:

## Technical Architecture

### Supported Card Types

#### Calypso Cards
**Security Model**:
- Mandatory SAM authentication for all operations
- Secure session management with cryptographic verification
- Full transaction traceability and audit logging
- Support for multiple contracts (1-4 depending on card type)

**Processing Flow**:
1. Card detection and AID selection
2. Environment record validation
3. Event analysis and contract priority evaluation
4. Best contract search with cryptographic verification
5. Counter updates within secure session
6. Event creation and session closure

#### Storage Cards
**Simplified Model**:
- Basic read/write operations without SAM requirements
- Single contract per card
- Streamlined validation procedure
- **Note**: Production implementations should add appropriate security measures

**Processing Flow**:
1. Card detection and data reading
2. Contract validation and date checking
3. Counter updates for applicable contract types
4. Event creation and data writing

### Key Classes

**TicketingService**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the complete ticketing process lifecycle
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Plugin initialization and cleanup
  - NFC detection management
  - Card selection scenario configuration
  - Validation procedure coordination
- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - `onResume()`: Initialize plugins, start NFC detection
  - `onPause()`: Stop NFC detection
  - `onDestroy()`: Clean up plugins and observers

**ReaderRepository**
- **Purpose**: Abstraction layer between business logic and hardware
- **Functions**:
  - Reader connection management
  - Plugin-specific configuration
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Status monitoring and reporting

**CardReaderObserver**
- **Purpose**: Handles card reader events from Keyple SDK

  - `CARD_REMOVED`: Card removal detection
  - `READER_FAILURE`: Hardware error conditions

**Card Repository Implementations**

**CalypsoCardRepository**

- Manages secure sessions and SAM integration
- Handles complex contract priority logic
- Provides cryptographic verification of contracts

**StorageCardRepository**
- Implements simplified validation for storage cards
- Direct read/write operations without secure sessions
- Single contract processing

### Validation Procedure Details

#### Contract Priority System

The validation procedure processes contracts in priority order:

| Priority | Contract Type | Validation Logic |
|:---------|:--------------|:-----------------|
| 1        | Season Pass   | Check validity date only |
| 2        | Multi-trip    | Check counter > 0, decrement |
| 3        | Stored Value  | Check balance >= amount, decrement |
| 31       | Expired       | Skip (automatic marking) |

#### Best Contract Search Algorithm

```
1. Read environment and validate card expiration
2. Analyze last event for contract priorities
3. Create ordered list of valid contract priorities
4. For each contract in priority order:
   a. Read and validate contract record
   b. Check contract-specific conditions
   c. If valid, select for validation
   d. If expired, mark priority as expired
5. Update selected contract counter
6. Create new validation event
7. Close secure session
```

### Custom Terminal Integration

To add support for new terminal hardware:

1. **Create Plugin Implementation**:
```kotlin
class CustomTerminalPlugin : Plugin {
    override fun getName(): String = "CustomTerminal"
    
    override fun getReaders(): Map<String, Reader> {
        // Initialize terminal-specific readers
    }
}
```

2. **Register Plugin**:
```kotlin
// In DeviceSelectionActivity
KeyplePluginRegistry.registerPlugin(CustomTerminalPluginFactory())
```

3. **Add UI Option**:
- Add terminal selection in device selection screen
- Configure plugin-specific settings
- Test with target hardware

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SAM not detected"**
- Verify SAM is properly inserted in reader
- Check SAM compatibility with cards (Test vs Production keys)
- Ensure SAM reader is powered and connected
- Validate SAM status in terminal diagnostics

**"Card validation failed"**
- Check card has valid contracts loaded via Reload Demo
- Verify card AID is supported by application
- Ensure contract validity dates are current
- Check sufficient balance/trips for validation

**"NFC detection not working"**
- Enable NFC in Android system settings
- Grant NFC permissions to application
- Keep device stable during card reading
- Try different card positioning on NFC antenna

**"Plugin initialization failed"**
- Ensure proper plugin libraries are included
- Check hardware drivers are installed
- Verify device compatibility with selected plugin
- Review device selection matches actual hardware

### Debug Mode

Enable comprehensive logging:

1. **Settings** → **Enable Debug Mode**
2. **View logs** via Android Studio logcat:
```bash
adb logcat -s "KeypleValidation"
```

3. **Key log categories**:
- `CardReader`: Hardware communication
- `TicketingService`: Business logic flow
- `ValidationProcedure`: Card processing steps
- `SAMManager`: Security module operations

### Performance Optimization

**Card Reading Speed**:
- Minimize APDU command exchanges
- Use efficient file reading strategies
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize secure session management

**Battery Life** (for portable terminals):
- Implement sleep mode between validations
- Manage NFC discovery cycles efficiently
- Reduce screen brightness during idle
- Use background processing for non-critical tasks

## Proprietary Plugins

### Activation Process

By default, proprietary plugins are deactivated. To enable:

1. **Request Access**: Contact [CNA](https://calypsonet.org/contact-us/) for desired plugin
2. **Install Plugin**: Copy provided `.aar` file to `/app/libs/` directory
3. **Remove Mock**: Delete corresponding `-mock.aar` file from `/app/libs/`

## Security Considerations

### SAM Security
- Use production SAMs only in live environments
- Secure physical access to SAM readers
- Implement SAM lifecycle management procedures
- Monitor SAM authentication failures

### Data Protection
- All validation events are cryptographically secured
- Card data transmission uses secure channels
- No sensitive data stored on mobile device
- Audit logging for compliance and forensics

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for any server communication
- Implement certificate pinning for production
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Monitor for unusual transaction patterns
