Native Android client for the Keyple Reload Demo, enabling secure contract loading onto Calypso cards through a distributed architecture with remote server management.

[⬅️ Back to Main Project](../../../../README.md)

## Overview

This Android application demonstrates distributed ticketing where all card operations are managed remotely by a Java server with SAM integration. The mobile client provides the user interface and NFC card communication while delegating all business logic and cryptographic operations to the server.

**Role in Ecosystem**: First step in the ticketing workflow - loads Season Pass and Multi-trip contracts onto cards for later validation and control.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- Android device with Android 7.0+ (API level 24+)
- NFC capability for contactless card reading
- Internet connectivity for server communication
- Compatible Calypso cards (see [supported AIDs](../common-lib/README.md#supported-card-applications))

### Server Requirements
- Running Keyple Demo Server with SAM integration
- Network connectivity between client and server
- Proper firewall configuration for server access

## Installation

### Download APK
1. Visit [Releases page](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing/releases)
2. Download latest `keyple-reload-android-X.Y.Z.apk`
3. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings
4. Install the APK file

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing.git
cd keyple-demo-ticketing/reloading-remote/client/keyple-mobile-android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Configuration

### Server Connection
1. Open **Settings** → **Server**
2. Configure server connection:
  - **Server URL**: `http://your-server:8080`
  - **Connection timeout**: 30 seconds (default)
  - **Read timeout**: 60 seconds (default)
3. Test connection using **Test Connection** button

### NFC Settings
1. Ensure NFC is enabled in Android settings
2. Grant NFC permissions to the application
3. Keep screen on during card operations for stable connection

### Card Reader Selection
The app supports multiple NFC reader types:
- **Contactless Support**: Standard Android NFC (all devices)
- **SIM Card**: OMAPI reader access (work in progress)
- **Embedded SE**: Wizway plugin for eSE (work in progress)

## Usage

### Quick Start Workflow

1. **Launch Application**
  - Select **Contactless Support** from main menu
  - Ensure server is running and accessible

2. **Card Personalization** (if needed)
  - Go to **Settings** → **Personalization**
  - Present card to initialize with clean state
  - Wait for confirmation message

3. **Read Card Content**
  - From main screen, tap **Contactless Support**
  - Present card to NFC reader
  - View existing contracts and validity status

4. **Load New Contract**
  - Select desired contract type from available options
  - Follow payment simulation workflow
  - Present card again to complete loading

### Screen Flow

```
Main Screen → Card Reader → Card Summary → Select Tickets → Checkout → Payment → Charge → Result
```

### Detailed Screen Guide

**Main Screen (`MainActivity`)**
- Setup and configuration access
- Reader type selection

**Home Screen (`HomeActivity`)**
- Menu for different card reader types
- Quick access to settings and personalization

**Settings Menu (`SettingsMenuActivity`)**
- **Server Settings**: Connection configuration
- **Configuration**: Plugin availability settings
- **Personalization**: Card reset and initialization

**Card Reader (`CardReaderActivity`)**
- Initializes selected Keyple plugin
- Establishes server connection with SAM integration
- Reads card content through secure session
- Displays connection status and progress

**Card Summary (`CardSummaryActivity`)**
- Shows current card content (Season Pass/Multi-trip)
- Displays contract validity and usage status
- Option to load additional contracts

**Select Tickets (`SelectTicketsActivity`)**
- Lists available products from server
- Shows pricing and validity information
- Contract selection for purchase

**Payment Simulation**
- **Checkout (`CheckoutActivity`)**: Simulates credit card payment
- **Payment Validated (`PaymentValidatedActivity`)**: Confirms payment success

**Contract Loading**
- **Charge (`ChargeActivity`)**: Loads selected contract onto card
- **Charge Result (`ChargeResultActivity`)**: Shows success/failure status

## Technical Architecture

### Key Classes

**TicketingService**
- Orchestrates the ticketing process lifecycle
- Manages Keyple plugin initialization and cleanup
- Handles NFC detection start/stop
- Coordinates with server for card operations

**ReaderRepository**
- Interface between business layer and card reader
- Abstracts reader-specific operations
- Provides consistent API for different reader types

**CardReaderObserver**
- Implements `CardReaderObserverSpi` from Keyple SDK
- Responds to card insertion/removal events
- Triggers appropriate business logic for card processing

**Server Communication**
- RESTful API client for server interaction
- Handles authentication and session management
- Manages secure data transmission for card operations

### Plugin Integration

The application supports multiple reader plugins:

**Standard Plugins** (always available):
- Android NFC plugin for standard contactless reading
- OMAPI plugin for SIM card access (development)

**Development Plugins**:
- Wizway plugin for embedded Secure Element access

### Security Model

**Distributed Security Architecture**:
- All cryptographic operations performed on server
- Client transmits card data securely to server
- Server manages SAM integration and secure sessions
- No sensitive cryptographic material stored on mobile device

## Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
./gradlew clean

# Build debug version
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release version  
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run tests
./gradlew test
```

### Development Configuration

**Debug Settings**:
- Enable debug logging in `application.properties`
- Use test server URL for development
- Mock server responses for offline development

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for business logic components
- Integration tests with mock server
- NFC simulation for testing without physical cards

### Adding New Readers

To integrate additional reader types:

1. Add plugin dependency to `build.gradle`
2. Implement reader-specific initialization in `TicketingService`
3. Add UI selection option in device selection screen
4. Test with target hardware platform

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Server connection failed"**
- Verify server URL and network connectivity
- Check firewall settings on server and client
- Ensure server is running with proper configuration

**"NFC not working"**
- Enable NFC in Android system settings
- Grant NFC permission to application
- Keep device stable during card reading

**"Card not recognized"**
- Verify card contains supported AID
- Check card is properly personalized
- Try different card positioning on NFC antenna

**"Loading failed"**
- Ensure server has SAM properly configured
- Check card has available contract slots
- Verify sufficient balance for stored value operations

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Configuration**
2. Enable **Debug Mode**
3. View logs in Android Studio logcat or device logs

### Server Connectivity Test

Test server connection:
```bash
# From development machine
curl http://your-server:8080/api/system/status

# Expected response
{"status": "UP", "readers": [...]}
```

## Known Limitations

- SIM Card and Embedded SE readers are work in progress
- Payment simulation only - no real payment processing
- Limited offline capability (server connection required)
- Single server connection (no failover support)
